# Cofoundry

Builds Proxmox VM templates from unattended Linux and Windows Server ISO
installations, then exports importable disk images that
[Coport](docs/coport.md) turns back into clonable templates on a Proxmox node.

Requires Proxmox VE 9 — `qm create --import-from` is what makes an image
installable without an archive.

[docs/windows-log.md](docs/windows-log.md) is the dated Windows experiment log —
history rather than reference. `docs/handoffs/` holds point-in-time session
snapshots; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#documentation-layout) for what goes where.
