# Debugging builds without burning hours

A Windows build takes ~1–3 hours and its provisioners run only at the very end,
so a naive debugging loop costs one hypothesis per three hours. That loop once
cost four consecutive failed 2025 builds that produced **no diagnosis at all** —
roughly twelve hours to learn nothing.

Everything here attacks that. The ordering is deliberate: **shorten the feedback
loop before hunting the bug.** Almost every technique below pays for itself
within one avoided rebuild.

For the automated evidence bundle a failed build leaves behind, see
[diagnostics.md](diagnostics.md). This document is what to do by hand, and how to
write code that explains itself the next time.

## 1. Keep the failing VM alive

Packer deletes the build VM within seconds of a provisioner erroring. Before
killing a build worth understanding:

```sh
qm set <vmid> --protection 1     # packer's destroy now fails; the VM survives
```

**This is the highest-leverage trick here.** It converts "3 hours per hypothesis"
into "minutes per hypothesis", because candidate fixes can be tried against the
actual failing guest. The Appx root cause was found this way in about ten minutes
after four blind rebuilds had failed to find it.

Clear it when done, or the VMID cannot be reused:

```sh
qm set <vmid> --protection 0 && qm stop <vmid> && qm destroy <vmid> --purge
```

## 2. Talk to the live guest

```sh
qm guest exec <vmid> --timeout 60 -- powershell -NoProfile -Command '<script>'
```

- There is **no `--output-format` option.** Passing one makes every call fail.
  Two hours were lost to this once, logging `<agent-unavailable>` throughout.
- Output is JSON with the guest's stdout in `out-data`. **Parse it with
  `python3`, not `sed`** — the payload contains escaped quotes and CRLFs.
- For anything with quoting, write the script to a file and send it base64, which
  removes every nested-quoting decision:

    ```sh
    ENC=$(iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16LE /root/probe.ps1 | base64 -w0)
    qm guest exec <vmid> --timeout 120 -- powershell -NoProfile -EncodedCommand "$ENC"
    ```

- **The agent is not a health signal.** It answers while Setup sits at an error
  dialog, and goes unresponsive for minutes under load. "Agent up" proves nothing
  about whether the guest is progressing.
- **Validate the shape of what comes back.** After a timed-out call, `qm guest
exec` can return a _different_ command's `out-data` — once dumping megabytes of
  CBS log into a disk-usage timeline. Emit a known prefix and reject replies that
  lack it.

## 3. Is the guest hung, or just slow?

A blank console framebuffer is not evidence of a hang — a booting Windows guest
shows one for minutes. Ask the hypervisor whether the VM is doing work:

```sh
P=$(qm list | awk '$1==<vmid>{print $6}')
cat /proc/$P/stat | awk '{print "utime="$14" stime="$15}'   # sample twice, 3s apart
grep -E 'read_bytes|write_bytes' /proc/$P/io                 # sample twice
```

Rising CPU jiffies and rising I/O mean it is grinding, not wedged. A 2025 clone
spent several minutes at ~80% of 4 cores during first-boot specialize with a
black screen throughout, and still finished inside verify's 900s window.

## 4. Parse-check PowerShell locally — it is nearly free

`Finalize.ps1` runs only inside a Windows guest, ~3 hours in, as the last
provisioner before sysprep. A syntax error there is caught by _nothing_ else:
packer uploads the file verbatim and the guest fails at parse time.

PowerShell runs on Linux, including arm64:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.4.6/powershell-7.4.6-linux-arm64.tar.gz \
  -o /tmp/pwsh.tar.gz          # or -linux-x64.tar.gz; check `uname -m` first
sudo mkdir -p /opt/pwsh && sudo tar -xzf /tmp/pwsh.tar.gz -C /opt/pwsh
sudo chmod +x /opt/pwsh/pwsh && sudo ln -sf /opt/pwsh/pwsh /usr/local/bin/pwsh
```

A whole-tree check then costs milliseconds:

```sh
pwsh -NoProfile -Command '
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.ps1 recipes/ | ForEach-Object {
  $e = $null
  [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile($_.FullName, [ref]$null, [ref]$e) | Out-Null
  if ($e.Count) { $e | ForEach-Object { "{0} line {1}: {2}" -f $_.Extent.File, $_.Extent.StartLineNumber, $_.Message } }
}'
```

`tests/windows-ps-syntax.test.ts` runs exactly this and **skips cleanly when
`pwsh` is absent**, so it costs nothing on a machine without it. Install it if you
touch `recipes/_shared/windows/`. It is also the fastest way to check what a
PowerShell expression actually does — operator precedence, format strings, `-f`
binding, regex behaviour — without a guest in the loop.

## 5. Make the failure explain itself

**Anything that fails inside a guest must report through the one channel that
outlives the guest — packer's stdout.** "Check `C:\...\setuperr.log`" is useless
advice when the VM holding that log is deleted seconds later. Two 3h04m builds
died that way before `Finalize.ps1` was taught to dump `setuperr.log`,
`setupact.log`, and the arming registry state into its own output.

When a step retries, dump on **each** failure, not once at the end — dumping only
after the loop loses attempt 1, because attempt 2 overwrites `Panther`.

The inverse also has to hold: **a message that reaches the reader must belong to
the thing that failed.** `captureRemote` inherits stderr by default, so verify's
guest-exec loops used to let `qm`'s own diagnosis (`QEMU guest agent is not
running`) land raw in the log on no particular line, while the failing check said
only "Command failed with exit code 255". Both halves were wrong: failure wording
for the ordinary case (a guest that reboots during Cloudbase-Init), and no wording
at all for the real one. Guest exec now passes `captureStderr: true`, folding
those lines into the transport error where the check reports them, and the wait
loops restate the condition as progress (`guest agent down — Cloudbase-Init
reboots the guest once (2m10s of 15m00s)`). Match patterns against wording only
`qm` can emit: the transport error carries the whole failed command line, and
every guest-exec command line contains `--timeout <n>`.

## 6. Silence must never be a valid state

If "working normally" and "died" look the same, you cannot tell them apart under
pressure. Two instances bit us in one day:

- A `grep` filter matching only success markers would have stayed silent through
  a crashloop. Monitor filters must match **every terminal state** — widen the
  alternation rather than narrow it.
- A node-side watcher collapsed repeated "guest agent down" lines into one, so a
  dead watcher and a busy guest produced identical logs. Fixed by heartbeating
  every 15th poll.

## 7. Distrust probes that cannot distinguish the states you care about

Before trusting a probe, ask: _what would this print in the failure case?_ If the
answer is "the same thing", it is not a probe. Two examples that each produced a
confident wrong conclusion:

- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Measure-Object
Length -Sum` returns **0 for an ACL-protected populated tree**, identically to
  an empty one, because the errors are silenced. Count enumeration errors before
  believing a size.
- Reading free space _after_ deleting a multi-GB file races NTFS's reclaim: the
  same code logged "13.9 GB free" and "1.0 GB free" on consecutive runs. Worse,
  neither value could distinguish "13 GB was zeroed and released" from "nothing
  was written". Report the thing you are responsible for — bytes written.

The same trap has a scheduling flavour: **"the check failed" and "the check never
ran" are different states, and a retry budget is what keeps them apart.**
`src/verify/guest.ts` retries only transport errors, never a real non-zero exit —
but a budget too short to outlast the outage collapses the two states anyway. A
3h windows-server-2025 build was lost that way: `QEMU guest agent is not running`
came in runs of ~30–35s under concurrent-build load, and a policy of two attempts
a flat 5s apart covered ~13s, so two checks burned both attempts inside one outage
and were reported as image defects. Size a retry budget from the measured outage,
not from a round number — the backoff is now 5s/10s/20s, asserted against that
reasoning in `tests/verify-guest.test.ts`.

## 8. Guard every fix, and negative-control every guard

A guard that cannot fail is worse than none — it produces false confidence. One
here asserted `toContain('allow_reboot=false')`, which matched a _comment_: the
setting could be deleted and the test still passed.

After writing a guard, **break the code and watch the test fail**, then restore:

```sh
cp file file.bak
perl -0pi -e 's/<the line the guard protects>//' file
bun test <the test>        # MUST fail
cp file.bak file
bun test <the test>        # MUST pass
```

For PowerShell and shell assets with no runtime in the test process, a static
guard over the file's text is legitimate — say so in the test comment, so nobody
mistakes it for a behavioural one.

## 9. Pick the cheapest test that can falsify the hypothesis

| Method                                                 | Cost    | Good for                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `bun test` / `pwsh` parse                              | seconds | syntax, invariants, orderings           |
| `qm guest exec` on a preserved VM                      | seconds | guest state, candidate fixes            |
| Offline image inspection (`qemu-nbd` + mount, `reged`) | ~5 min  | what a built artifact actually contains |
| Restore + boot + `qm agent ping`                       | ~10 min | does a clone come up at all             |
| `cf verify`                                            | ~15 min | the full check battery                  |
| Full build                                             | 1–3 h   | last resort                             |

A direct boot test beats `cf verify` for _diagnosis_ — faster, and no battery to
time out. Use `cf verify` to prove a thing works, not to find out why it does not.

## 10. Operational traps that cost real time here

- **`pkill -f <pattern>` can kill your own SSH session**, because the session's
  argv contains the pattern you just typed. It happened twice. Match the
  executable and kill by PID:

    ```sh
    ps -eo pid,args --no-headers | awk '$2 ~ /^\/usr\/bin\/packer$/ {print $1}' | xargs -r kill -9
    ```

    Equally, `ps ... | awk '$2 ~ /script\.sh/'` matches nothing when `$2` is
    `/bin/bash` — that silently failed to kill a watcher, and a second copy was
    started, interleaving two formats into one log.

- **Track guest VMs by NAME, never VMID** — cf derives the VMID from the netslot,
  so a retry changes it. A capture pinned to a VMID watched the wrong machine
  through five failures.
- **Run one `cf` operation at a time.** Two concurrent runs recycle the same
  scratch VMID, and the first run's delayed cleanup destroys the second's VM.
- **`cf` retries resurrect a killed build** (attempts 2/3, 3/3). A build that
  "reappears" with PPID 1 is usually that, not a stray.
- **Check for another agent or session** before blaming infrastructure:
  `ps -eo args | grep claude`.
- **`scp` to the node fails**; pipe instead: `ssh root@node 'cat > /path' < file`.
- **Do not run `cf clean` casually** — it removes uploaded ISOs, including large
  ones you will wait to re-download.
- The node→local artifact download runs at ~1 MB/s over the tailnet, against
  ~12 MB/s for the node's own internet fetch. `cf verify` reads the artifact
  **from the node**, so that download never blocks verification; it writes to a
  `.tmp` and resumes.

## 11. Read the guest's own logs, in the right order

- **The System event log is the only thing that names a reboot initiator.**
  `setupact.log` and CBS only ever show TrustedInstaller _reacting_. Extract
  `Windows/System32/winevt/Logs/System.evtx` offline and parse with `python-evtx`
  in a venv (system pip is PEP-668 managed).
- **Read the vendor's source rather than inferring behaviour.** `msiextract` on
  the cached Cloudbase-Init MSI settled two questions that had each cost a build
  cycle.
- **A long warning list is not a severity signal.** One image listed 41
  "blocking" Appx packages and sysprep objected to exactly one.
