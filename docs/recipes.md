# Recipes

All current recipes perform an unattended ISO installation on Proxmox and then
export a vzdump artifact. The `# build_vmid` in each HCL file is a stable recipe
base ID. During `cf build`, networked installers use
`base_build_vmid * 100 + slot_index` so parallel builds do not share VM state.

The Windows build disk is intentionally temporary working space. The guest and
host shrink steps reduce it to `# final_disk_size` before export.

## Adding or updating a recipe

Copy the nearest recipe in the same OS family, then update every piece of
release identity together:

- header metadata: `display`, `group`, `build_vmid`, `iso_url`,
  `iso_target_path`, checksum URL, and filename pattern where present;
- the `build_vmid` default and recipe locals;
- source name, ISO filename, checksum, and unattended-install paths;
- image/edition name and release-specific drivers;
- CPU and memory if the installer genuinely requires different resources.

Choose a unique base VMID in the family's existing range. Do not choose a live
slot-derived ID directly.

Keep disks small. The Linux installers currently fit in 5G. For Windows, retain
the temporary build/final shrink design and change the final size only after
checking the installed minimum and the vzdump sparse-data report:

```text
INFO: backup is sparse: X GiB (Y%) total zero data
```

Run a full build after recipe changes. HCL syntax alone cannot validate an ISO's
image names, boot sequence, driver directories, or unattended installer schema.

### Ubuntu autoinstall

Copy the matching `user-data` and empty `meta-data` files under
`recipes/<recipe>/http/`. Update release-specific package or boot arguments only
when required by that installer.

Keep `boot_key_interval = "100ms"`. Proxmox types the boot command through the
QEMU `sendkey` API; with no interval the guest keyboard buffer intermittently
drops characters. This was observed corrupting the initramfs `ip=` netmask
(`…255.255.255.0` arriving as `…255.25.250`), which the installer could not
parse — networking never came up, the autoinstall user-data was never fetched,
and the build failed with a 30-minute SSH timeout. The failure was diagnosed
from a framebuffer screenshot captured by the build diagnostics recorder (see
[architecture.md](architecture.md#failure-diagnostics)); spacing the keystrokes
resolves it.

### Debian preseed

Copy a nearby `preseed.cfg`. The committed file must contain
`__PACKER_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY__`, not a real key. `scripts/inject-placeholders.sh`
generates a fresh ephemeral Ed25519 key for each build and replaces either the
placeholder or a previously injected `packer-<recipe>-*` key, so reruns remain
safe even without `git clean`.

### AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux kickstart

Copy the nearest `ks.cfg` and update repository/release details. These builds
also use the allocated NAT address and ephemeral SSH credentials.

### Windows Server

Read [`windows.md`](windows.md) before making any Windows change.
In particular:

- look up the current Proxmox `ostype` enum instead of guessing a release-named
  value;
- copy `autounattend.xml` and update the image name plus all VirtIO driver
  directories;
- preserve the shared scripts under `recipes/_shared/windows/`;
- keep 2025-only requirements, including TPM/CPU/CompactOS behavior, scoped to
  the versions that need them;
- record every debugging experiment in [`windows.md`](windows.md).

Microsoft evaluation links sometimes resolve to a registration page instead of
an ISO. If validation reports an HTML download, obtain the current direct link
from the Microsoft Evaluation Center and update the recipe metadata and cached
ISO filename together.
