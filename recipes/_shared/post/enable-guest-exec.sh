# Enable the QEMU guest agent's guest-exec RPC on RHEL-family images.
#
# The build smoke test proves an exported template can reboot by reading the
# guest's kernel boot id over the guest agent's guest-exec RPC before and after
# a reboot (see src/verify/guest.ts, rebootGuest/readBootId). Debian and Ubuntu
# ship qemu-guest-agent with every RPC permitted, so they pass; RHEL ships it
# with guest-exec denied, so almalinux/rocky fail the smoke test with
# "Command guest-exec has been disabled" and never read a boot id.
#
# The deny is expressed two different ways depending on the release:
#
#   * el8  - a *block* list, BLACKLIST_RPC=...,guest-exec,guest-exec-status,...
#            Everything not listed is allowed, so we drop just the two
#            guest-exec entries and leave the file RPCs blocked.
#   * el9+ - an *allow* list, FILTER_RPC_ARGS="--allow-rpcs=...". Everything not
#            listed is denied, so we add guest-exec/guest-exec-status when they
#            are missing (el9 omits both; el10 omits guest-exec-status).
#
# This must run from a Packer provisioner *after* `dnf update`, because a
# qemu-guest-agent package refresh can rewrite /etc/sysconfig/qemu-ga back to
# the shipped defaults, silently reverting an edit made during the kickstart.
