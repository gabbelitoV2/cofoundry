# export-disks.sh — export the built VM's disks as importable images.
#
# Sourced by export-and-cleanup.sh, so it reuses that scope's _pve() dispatch
# (local bash vs. ssh to the node) and CF_* environment.
#
# Replaces vzdump. A vzdump archive can only be restored with qmrestore, which
# produces a VM template and therefore occupies a VMID on every node it lands
# on. A disk image is data on a storage: `qm create --scsiN <storage>:0,
# import-from=...` builds a VM from it without reserving anything, and an
# import store on shared storage serves a whole cluster from one copy.
#
# Compression has to live INSIDE the image. Proxmox refuses to decompress on
# the import path -- API2/Storage/Status.pm rejects `compression` for any
# content type other than `iso` -- so artifacts cannot ship as .zst.
# `qemu-img convert -c` writes compressed qcow2 clusters that qemu reads
# natively and that Proxmox accepts as a plain .qcow2.
#
# Populates these parallel arrays for the caller, one entry per artifact:
#   CF_DISK_SLOT   scsi0, efidisk0
#   CF_DISK_ROLE   system, efivars
#   CF_DISK_FORMAT qcow2, raw
#   CF_DISK_FILE   local path under CF_OUT_DIR
#   CF_DISK_OPTS   JSON object of image-describing options
#   CF_DISK_VSIZE  guest-visible size, or "" where it does not apply

# _volid_path <volid> — resolve a Proxmox volid to a node-side file path.
#
# `pvesm path` only *constructs* a path from the volid; it does not check that
# anything is there. A config entry naming a file that no longer exists
# therefore resolves cleanly and only fails later, at the copy, with a bare
# "cannot stat" that says nothing about why. Assert existence here and dump the
# VM's image directory when it fails, so the next occurrence is diagnosable from
# packer's stdout instead of needing another multi-hour build to reproduce.
#
# This is not hypothetical. A windows-server-2025 build on 2026-08-25 reached
# the export with `efidisk0: local:200205/base-200205-disk-0.raw` in its config
# and no such file on disk, because a CONCURRENT build reclaimed its netslot and
# destroyed the VM mid-export:
#
#   evicting orphan VM 200205 on node us-southwest-2 squatting netslot 05
#
# Packer stops the VM and templates it before this post-processor runs, so the
# whole export happens with the build VM stopped. netslot.ts's reclaim treats a
# slot as orphaned when no *running* VM carries its MAC (slot_mac_running), and
# a legitimately-stopped exporting VM looks exactly like that. Any build racing
# the tail of another can therefore delete it out from under this script.
#
# Every diagnostic here goes to STDERR on purpose: this function is called as
# `path=$(_volid_path ...)`, so anything on stdout is captured into the caller's
# variable instead of reaching packer's log — which would make the failure
# silent at exactly the moment it needs to explain itself.

  # --- EFI variable store (efidisk0), staged FIRST ---------------------------
  # OVMF splits into read-only firmware code on the node and a per-VM writable
  # variable store. The varstore holds the boot entry Windows Setup wrote
  # (Boot0000 -> \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi), the enrolled Secure Boot
  # keys, and any dbx revocations WU.ps1 applied. None of that can be
  # reconstructed from flags, and a freshly allocated varstore has none of it.
  # Proxmox 9 can import one: `qm create --efidisk0 <storage>:0,import-from=`.
  # Without that parameter this whole design does not work for Windows.
  #
  # Copied before the system disk on purpose. It is ~540 KB against a 32 G
  # qcow2 conversion that runs for minutes, so staging it first costs nothing
  # and removes that entire window from the time between resolving its path and
  # having its bytes. A 2026-08-25 windows-server-2025 build lost the varstore
  # inside exactly that window (see _volid_path above).
