# shrink-disk.sh — shrink the OS (scsi0) disk to CF_FINAL_DISK_SIZE before vzdump.
#
# Sourced by vzdump-and-cleanup.sh, so it reuses that scope's _pve() dispatch
# (local bash vs. ssh to the node), CF_BUILT_VMID, and CF_FINAL_DISK_SIZE.
# Only invoked when CF_FINAL_DISK_SIZE is set.
#
# This only shrinks the qcow2 *virtual* size — it does not move partitions. The
# guest (Finalize.ps1 on Windows) must already have shrunk its filesystem so the
# last partition ends below CF_FINAL_DISK_SIZE. Fails closed (set -e in the
# caller) so a bad shrink can never publish a corrupt template.
#
# First pass: file-backed qcow2 on `dir` storage only. Anything else aborts.
