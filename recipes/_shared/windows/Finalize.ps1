# Also overwrite cloudbase-init-unattend.conf -- the config the specialize-pass
# RunSynchronous command runs with on a clone's first boot. The MSI's shipped
# copy ran the FULL plugin stage during specialize, which is the root of the
# password-overwrite defect: SetUserPasswordPlugin consumed its run-once slot
# *before* the oobeSystem pass applied the seeded build AdministratorPassword,
# so the build's throwaway password ended up as the clone's final credential
# (verified live on Server 2025, 2026-07-21; see docs/windows.md). Restricting
# the specialize run to MTU + hostname leaves SetUserPasswordPlugin for the
# post-OOBE service run, whose write lands *after* oobeSystem and therefore
# wins -- the same ordering the delayed-auto start gives Server 2019.
# Logged to its own file so cloudbase-init.log stays the service run's record
# (cf verify's cloudbase-init-completed parses that log).
#
# allow_reboot=false is LOAD-BEARING and must not be dropped. SetHostNamePlugin
# requests a reboot after renaming the clone. With cloudbase-init's default
# allow_reboot=true it acts on that itself: configure_host() calls
# osutils.terminate(), which stops the cloudbase-init *service* -- but during
# specialize this runs as a console process, so the service is not started and
# ControlService raises (1062, 'The service has not been started.'), unhandled:
#
#   CRITICAL cloudbaseinit [-] Unhandled error: pywintypes.error:
#     (1062, 'ControlService', 'The service has not been started.')
#
# That non-zero exit takes the `|| exit 2` branch of the RunSynchronous command,
# SetupUGC returns 3, the specialize pass fails, and every clone loops on
# "The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error"
# without ever reaching OOBE. Observed on a 2026-08-02 clone of an image the
# export gate had already certified as correctly generalized and armed.
#
# The reboot is supposed to be the *unattend's* job: the shipped
# RunSynchronous command is `cloudbase-init.exe ... && exit 1 || exit 2`, and
# exit 1 is what signals WillReboot=OnRequest. cloudbase-init must exit 0 for
# that to happen, which is exactly what allow_reboot=false produces.
#
# reset_service_password=false is load-bearing for the same reason, and was the
# *next* failure once allow_reboot was fixed (2026-08-02, clone of a gate-
# certified image). configure_host() begins with
# _reset_service_password_and_respawn(), which resets the cloudbase-init service
# account's password and re-spawns as that user. During specialize this is a
# console run, not the service, and the call dies:
#
#   init.py configure_host() -> _reset_service_password_and_respawn(osutils)
#   -> osutils.reset_service_password() -> OpenSCManager
#   pywintypes.error: (1115, 'OpenSCManager', 'A system shutdown is in progress.')
#
# Same consequence as before: non-zero exit -> `|| exit 2` -> SetupUGC 4 ->
# specialize fails -> the clone loops on "The computer restarted unexpectedly".
#
# BOTH flags exist in the MSI's stock cloudbase-init-unattend.conf. They went
# missing because this file is overwritten wholesale, so any future rewrite of
# this block must carry them forward.

#
# TERMINOLOGY -- four different things get called "specialize" around here, and
# conflating them has confused every reader of this block so far:
#
#   1. the specialize PASS      Windows boot phase. Generates the new SID and
#                               machine identity. Always runs on a generalized
#                               image; nothing in this file touches it.
#   2. the RunSynchronous LIST  commands the answer file asks that pass to run.
#   3. cloudbase-init's COMMAND one entry in that list. <-- this is what the
#                               loop below deletes, and the ONLY thing removed.
#   4. cloudbase-init-unattend.conf   the config file that command ran with.
#                               Unused by our clones once (3) is gone, but still
#                               live for anyone re-sysprepping with the vendor's
#                               untouched conf\Unattend.xml. See that block above.
#
# The pass keeps running and still carries one command of ours (the profile
# cleanup added below). "Removed the specialize command" never meant the pass.
#
# The MSI ships (3) as `cloudbase-init.exe --config-file …-unattend.conf && exit 1
# || exit 2`, where exit 1 means "reboot requested" (WillReboot=OnRequest). Every
# clone failure chased on 2026-08-02 traced back to that command:
#
#   allow_reboot default true   -> crashed stopping its own service (1062)
#   reset_service_password true -> crashed on OpenSCManager (1115)
#   SetHostNamePlugin           -> renamed the machine during the pass, and the
#                                  pending reboot landed mid-OOBE, leaving
#                                  SetupType=2 + OOBEInProgress=1 and setup.exe
#                                  looping on "The computer restarted unexpectedly"
#
# Each was fixed and the next surfaced. With SetHostNamePlugin removed the command
# did nothing but MTU, and the guest still rebooted ~44s into the pass with
# cloudbase-init's log ending mid-plugin -- so the command was still derailing
# the pass without doing anything the post-OOBE service run does not already do.
#
# Removing it is not a loss of function. The command existed only to keep
# SetUserPasswordPlugin *out* of the specialize pass (it would consume its
# run-once slot before oobeSystem seeds the AdministratorPassword, shipping the
# build's throwaway password). Deleting the command achieves that outright, and
# the post-OOBE service run still applies MTU, hostname and password in the
# correct order.
#
# What this costs: the hostname now lands AFTER OOBE rather than during the pass,
# so a clone is briefly reachable under the random WIN-XXXXXXX name sysprep gave
# it before cloudbase-init renames it and reboots (~2 min). That is why
# cf verify's hostname-applied check runs in the post-reboot phase.
#
# The pass is then just our profile cleanup: one command, exit 0, no reboot
# request, nothing that can strand OOBE.

#
# This bit the build twice on 2026-08-01, the second time because only half the
# teardown was moved:
#   13:26Z  the firewall rules ran before sysprep. The build NIC is on an
#           unidentified (Public-profile) network, so removing them dropped the
#           session mid-script.
#   21:45Z  the firewall move worked -- Finalize reached the Appx step for the
#           first time -- but the Basic/AllowUnencrypted unpin was still up
#           there, and packer connects with exactly Basic over unencrypted HTTP.
#           Turning both off cut the session just as effectively.
#
# In both cases the script kept running on the guest while its output and exit
# code went nowhere, and packer read the disconnect as provisioner success and
# exported a never-generalized template. That is the 2026-07-31 silent export.
#
# Running it here is safe: sysprep used /quit, so the machine is still up, and
# registry writes after generalize land in the sealed image (same reason the WU
# policy restore above sits here). Losing the session now costs nothing, because
# the only remaining action is the power-off.
