 * Proxmox storage types whose volumes are regular files on a mounted path,
 * i.e. `pvesm path <volid>` yields a local file `test -f` accepts. Only these
 * can hold the file-backed qcow2 that the disk-shrink post-processor
 * (recipes/_shared/post/shrink-disk.sh) resizes with `qemu-img resize --shrink`.
 * Block/dataset backends (zfspool, lvmthin, rbd, ...) make that script refuse —
 * hours into the build, inside vzdump-and-cleanup.sh's `set -e` — so they must
 * be rejected before Packer ever starts.
 *
 * `glusterfs` is deliberately absent: although the volume is qcow2 on a FUSE
 * mount, GlusterfsPlugin::path() returns a `gluster://server/volume/...` URI
 * for VM images, so the shrink script's `test -f "$path"` guard would still
 * refuse it at post-processor time.
